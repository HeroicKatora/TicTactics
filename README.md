# TicTactics

This project aims to introduce a protocol for engine of the fairly popular game "TicTactics" for Android. 
This is to standarize engines and compare them in their strength. 

The engine that is also developed in this repository is an implementation of this protocol. It is organized so that the specific evaluation algorithms may be switched out easily, as well as to feature a comparison between different search algorithms in the graphs (and see the performance impact).
